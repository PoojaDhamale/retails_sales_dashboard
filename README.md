# Retail Sales Dashboard & Customer Segmentation

A Streamlit dashboard to analyze retail sales and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

---

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding retail sales and customer patterns using Python.  
The dashboard allows you to:

- Explore top-selling products  
- Track monthly sales trends  
- Identify top customers by spend  
- Analyze revenue by country  
- Calculate average basket size  
- Segment customers using **RFM analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

I built this project to demonstrate **data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and interactive dashboards** skills.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** with `pandas`  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`  
- **RFM Customer Segmentation**  
- **Interactive Dashboard** using `Streamlit`  
- Downloadable RFM customer table

## Technologies Used
- Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `streamlit`)  
- Excel / CSV datasets

## Dataset
The original dataset is large and **not included** in the repository.  
You can download it from [Online Retail II Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II).  

> For demonstration purposes, you can also use a small sample dataset (`sample_data.xlsx`).
